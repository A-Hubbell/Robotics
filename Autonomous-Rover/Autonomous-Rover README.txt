This folder contains code used for controlling a four-wheeled vehicle driven using DC motors with independent wheel control. The vehicle is navigated using measurements taken from an ultrasonic rangefinder mounted on a servo motor. This rangefinder sweeps 180 degrees in front of the vehicle to determine the path with the farthest obstructions. This is a project that is in-progress, so I will be adding commits more frequently than other projects in order to document the creation process. \

This code currently works using the Adafruit Motor Shield v2 and four DC motors. The integration of the ultrasonic rangefinder has not been tested yet, however the necessary code has already been written.\
